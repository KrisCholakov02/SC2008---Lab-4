# 🔍 Network Traffic Analysis

## 📌 Overview
This project focuses on analyzing network data logs to uncover insights into network traffic patterns, top communicators, and potential security concerns. By processing raw packet data, we identify **top talkers and listeners, transport and application protocols, traffic intensity, geolocation insights**, and even potential **port scanning activities**.

## 📊 Key Highlights
- **Top Talkers & Listeners:** Identify the most active IP addresses in the network.
- **Protocol Breakdown:** Analyze TCP, UDP, and other transport protocols.
- **Application Insights:** Determine the most commonly used network services.
- **Traffic Intensity:** Estimate network congestion and data flow over time.
- **Geolocation Mapping:** Visualize network activity across the globe.
- **Security Analysis:** Detect anomalies like port scanning behavior.
